## 1. Executive Summary

CloudVoyager is a CLI tool that migrates complete SonarQube installations to SonarCloud **without requiring a single line of code to be re-scanned**. It achieves this by reverse-engineering SonarScanner's internal protobuf report protocol and rebuilding the entire data pipeline from the ground up in Node.js.

Where existing migration approaches require re-running CI/CD scanners against every project (a process that can take days or weeks across large portfolios), CloudVoyager extracts all data directly from SonarQube's API and repackages it into the exact binary format that SonarCloud's Compute Engine expects. The result is a migration that preserves code issues, security hotspots, measures, quality gates, quality profiles, permissions, and project metadata — all in a fraction of the time.

**Key metrics from production use:**
- 29 out of 29 projects migrated successfully in a single run (~16 minutes)
- 53 quality profiles migrated, 2 groups created
- 12+ distinct resource types migrated per organization (quality gates, profiles, permissions, templates, portfolios, groups, settings, tags, links, bindings, new code periods, webhooks)
- 6 platform binaries built automatically (all via Node.js SEA, with experimental Bun compile also available)

## 2. The Core Innovation: Reverse-Engineered Scanner Protocol

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### The Problem

SonarCloud's ingestion pipeline is not designed for external data import. It accepts data exclusively through a proprietary protobuf-based scanner report format, submitted to an internal Compute Engine (CE) endpoint. This format is undocumented for external consumers. There is no official migration path from SonarQube to SonarCloud that preserves historical data without re-scanning.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### The Approach

CloudVoyager reverse-engineered the scanner report protocol by:

1. **Capturing real scanner reports** — Running SonarScanner against known projects and intercepting the `.scannerwork/scanner-report/` output directory before submission.
2. **Decoding the protobuf schema** — Analyzing the `.pb` binary files to reconstruct the Protocol Buffer message definitions, including metadata, component structures, issue formats, measure encodings, active rule definitions, and changeset formats.
3. **Identifying encoding conventions** — Discovering that the report uses two distinct encoding styles:
   - **Single-message encoding** for metadata, components, and changesets (one protobuf message per file)
   - **Length-delimited streaming** for issues, measures, and active rules (multiple messages concatenated with varint length prefixes)
4. **Mapping the ZIP archive structure** — Reconstructing the exact file naming conventions (`metadata.pb`, `component-{ref}.pb`, `issues-{ref}.pb`, `measures-{ref}.pb`, `source-{ref}.txt`, `activerules.pb`, `changesets-{ref}.pb`, `context-props.pb`) expected by SonarCloud's CE endpoint.
5. **Rebuilding the pipeline in Node.js** — Implementing the entire encode-and-submit pipeline using `protobufjs`, with the proto schemas inlined directly into the bundle so no external schema files are needed at runtime.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Why This Matters

This is a novel capability. No other tool reconstructs SonarScanner's internal binary protocol to inject data into SonarCloud. The approach bypasses the need for source code access entirely — CloudVoyager needs only API-level access to SonarQube to produce a report that SonarCloud treats as a legitimate scanner submission.

## 3. Exhaustive SonarQube Data Extraction

CloudVoyager includes **24 specialized extractor modules** covering every category of data available through SonarQube's REST API. The extraction system is designed to be both exhaustive and resilient — server-wide extraction continues even if individual items fail.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Code and Analysis Data

| Extractor | Data Extracted | API Endpoints |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|

| **Rules** | Active rule details with language detection, severity mapping, and Clean Code impact extraction | `/api/rules/search` |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Administration and Governance Data

| Extractor | Data Extracted | API Endpoints |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Permissions** | Global permissions, project-level permissions, permission templates with group assignments | `/api/permissions/groups`, `/api/permissions/search_templates` |
| **Groups** | User group definitions with names and descriptions | `/api/user_groups/search` |
| **Portfolios** | Portfolio definitions, project associations, hierarchy | `/api/views/list` |

| **Server Info** | Server version, installed plugins, server-level settings, global webhooks | `/api/system/info`, `/api/plugins/installed`, `/api/settings/values`, `/api/webhooks/list` |
| **Webhooks** | Project-level webhook configurations | `/api/webhooks/list` |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Pagination Handling

The SonarQube API client handles pagination transparently via a `getPaginated` method that auto-fetches all pages and concatenates results. Different endpoints enforce different page size limits (some cap at 100 instead of 500), and each extractor handles this automatically.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 4. Protobuf Report Encoding Engine

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Two-Phase Encoding Architecture

CloudVoyager uses a **builder-encoder** architecture that separates message construction from binary serialization:

1. **Builder phase** (`builder.js`, `build-components.js`, `build-issues.js`, `build-measures.js`) — Transforms extracted SonarQube data into structured JavaScript objects matching the protobuf schema. Manages component reference mapping (sequential integer IDs) to maintain relationships between files, issues, and measures.

2. **Encoder phase** (`encoder.js`) — Takes the built messages and serializes them to binary protobuf format using `protobufjs`. Handles both single-message and length-delimited encoding styles.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Proto Schema Inlining

The `.proto` schema files are loaded as inline text at build time (via esbuild's `.proto: 'text'` loader for Node.js SEA builds, or Bun's `--loader .proto:text` for experimental Bun builds), eliminating any dependency on external schema files at runtime. When running from source, the files are read from the filesystem as a fallback. This means the standalone binary is entirely self-contained — no `.proto` files need to ship alongside it.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Encoding Methods

| Method | Encoding Style | Used For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| `encodeMetadata()` | Single message | Analysis metadata with SCM revision, org, branch info |
| `encodeComponent()` | Single message | Component definitions (project root, files) |
| `encodeIssueDelimited()` | Length-delimited stream | Issues with text ranges, flows, severity |
| `encodeMeasureDelimited()` | Length-delimited stream | Typed metric values (int, double, string) |
| `encodeActiveRuleDelimited()` | Length-delimited stream | Quality profile rules filtered by language |
| `encodeChangeset()` | Single message | SCM blame data per file |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Flat Component Model

Components use a flat structure where all files are direct children of the project root (no intermediate directory components). Line counts are derived from actual source file content rather than SonarQube's measures API, ensuring accuracy.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Measure Type Intelligence

Measures are encoded with the correct typed value field based on metric type:
- **Integer metrics** (`intValue`): `ncloc`, `complexity`, `violations`, `functions`, `classes`, etc.
- **Float/percentage metrics** (`doubleValue`): `coverage`, `duplicated_lines_density`, ratings
- **String metrics** (`stringValue`): `executable_lines_data`, `ncloc_data`, `alert_status`

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Active Rule Optimization

Active rules are filtered to only include languages actually used in the project, resulting in approximately **84% reduction in payload size** compared to including all rules from all profiles.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 5. SonarCloud Integration and Upload

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Report Packaging

The `ReportUploader` assembles the encoded protobuf messages into a ZIP archive that exactly matches SonarScanner's submission format:

```
scanner-report.zip
├── metadata.pb            # Analysis metadata with SCM revision
├── activerules.pb         # Language-filtered quality profile rules
├── context-props.pb       # SCM and CI detection metadata
├── component-{ref}.pb     # Component definitions (one per file)
├── issues-{ref}.pb        # Code issues per component
├── measures-{ref}.pb      # Metrics per component
├── changesets-{ref}.pb    # SCM blame per component
└── source-{ref}.txt       # Source code files (plain text)
```

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Compute Engine Submission

The report is submitted to SonarCloud's CE endpoint as a multipart form upload with:
- The ZIP archive as the report payload
- Project key and organization context
- Optional analysis parameters

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Duplicate Detection via SCM Revision

Each report includes an `scm_revision_id` (git commit hash) in its metadata. SonarCloud uses this to detect and reject duplicate submissions, preventing accidental data duplication across multiple migration runs.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Branch Name Resolution

The tool resolves the main branch name from SonarCloud (not SonarQube) to avoid mismatches where SonarQube uses "main" but SonarCloud expects "master" or vice versa.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Analysis Wait Mode

The `--wait` flag causes the tool to poll SonarCloud's CE task queue until the uploaded report has been fully analyzed. This is useful for CI/CD integration or sequential migration workflows where downstream steps depend on analysis completion.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 6. Full Organization Migration Pipeline

The `migrate` command orchestrates a comprehensive, multi-stage pipeline that transfers an entire SonarQube installation — not just code, but all organizational configuration.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->

   ↓
9. Migration Report Generation (JSON, TXT, MD, PDF)
```

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Non-Fatal Extraction Design

Server-wide extraction wraps each item in a non-fatal handler. If extracting quality gates succeeds but portfolio extraction fails, the pipeline continues — the failure is logged and reported, but does not block the rest of the migration.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Dry-Run Mode

The `--dry-run` flag executes all extraction and mapping steps but stops before making any changes to SonarCloud. This allows teams to:
- Review the generated organization mapping CSVs
- Validate that all SonarQube data is accessible
- Verify project key resolution without side effects

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 7. Issue and Hotspot Metadata Synchronization

After uploading the scanner report (which creates issues in SonarCloud with default "Open" status), CloudVoyager synchronizes the full lifecycle metadata from SonarQube.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Issue Sync

For each issue in SonarQube, the sync engine:

1. **Matches** the corresponding SonarCloud issue by composite key: `rule + component + line number`
2. **Transitions** the status using SonarCloud's workflow API:
   - `CONFIRMED` → `confirm`
   - `RESOLVED` → `resolve`
   - `ACCEPTED` → `accept`
   - `FALSE-POSITIVE` → `wontfix` (false positive)
   - `WONTFIX` → `wontfix`
3. **Assigns** the issue to the same user (if the user exists in SonarCloud)
4. **Copies comments** from SonarQube to SonarCloud
5. **Sets tags** to match the SonarQube tags

When multiple SonarCloud issues match the same composite key, the engine uses a first-unmatched-candidate strategy to avoid double-assignment.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Hotspot Sync

Security hotspots follow a similar pattern:

1. **Matches** by `rule + component + line number`
2. **Transitions** status: `TO_REVIEW` → `REVIEWED` with the appropriate resolution (`SAFE`, `FIXED`, `ACKNOWLEDGED`)
3. **Copies** review comments

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Standalone Metadata Sync

The `sync-metadata` command allows metadata synchronization to be run independently of the transfer pipeline. This is useful for:
- Retrying after rate-limit interruptions
- Syncing metadata for projects that were transferred in a previous run
- Running issue sync and hotspot sync selectively (`--skip-issue-metadata-sync`, `--skip-hotspot-metadata-sync`)

The operation is **idempotent** — running it multiple times will not duplicate comments or re-apply transitions.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 8. Quality Profile and Quality Gate Migration

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Quality Profile Migration

Quality profiles are migrated using SonarQube's **backup/restore XML format**, which preserves:
- All rule activations and deactivations
- Severity overrides
- Rule parameter values
- Language-specific configurations

**Built-in profile handling** is a noteworthy engineering detail. SonarCloud's built-in profiles (e.g., "Sonar way") cannot be overwritten. CloudVoyager handles this by:
1. Extracting the built-in profile's backup XML from SonarQube
2. Restoring it as a **custom profile** with a `(SonarQube Migrated)` suffix
3. Automatically assigning the migrated custom profile to each project

This ensures that the exact same rules are active in SonarCloud as they were in SonarQube, even when the built-in profiles have diverged between versions.

**Inheritance chains** are preserved by restoring profiles in dependency order — parent profiles are restored before their children.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Quality Profile Diff Reports

After migration, a side-by-side comparison report is generated per language:
- **Missing rules**: Active in SonarQube but not available in SonarCloud (may cause fewer issues to be detected)
- **Added rules**: Available in SonarCloud but not in SonarQube (may create new issues)

This enables teams to review rule parity before going live.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Quality Gate Migration

Quality gates are created with their full condition definitions (metric, operator, error threshold). Gate permissions are migrated for custom gates, and project assignments are applied per the organization mapping. Built-in gates are skipped since SonarCloud provides its own defaults.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 9. Permissions, Groups, and Governance Migration

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Group Migration

User groups are extracted from SonarQube and recreated in each target SonarCloud organization with matching names and descriptions.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Permission Migration

Three levels of permissions are migrated:

1. **Global Permissions** — Organization-wide permissions assigned to groups (e.g., admin, quality gate admin, quality profile admin)
2. **Project-Level Permissions** — Per-project group permissions (e.g., codeviewer, issueadmin, securityhotspotadmin)
3. **Permission Templates** — Reusable permission templates with group assignments, set as defaults where applicable

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Portfolio Migration

Portfolios are recreated in SonarCloud with their project associations preserved, maintaining the organizational hierarchy for executive-level views.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Project Configuration Migration

Per-project settings that are migrated include:
- **Project tags** — Custom categorization labels
- **Project links** — External URLs (CI/CD, documentation, issue trackers)
- **New code periods** — Definitions controlling which code is considered "new" for quality gate evaluation
- **DevOps bindings** — ALM platform integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket)
- **Project-level settings** — Non-inherited configuration values

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 10. Multi-Organization Mapping and DevOps Binding Awareness

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Intelligent Project-to-Organization Mapping

For enterprises migrating to multiple SonarCloud organizations, CloudVoyager automatically maps projects to target organizations based on their **DevOps platform bindings**:

1. Projects are grouped by their ALM binding (e.g., GitHub organization, GitLab group, Azure DevOps team)
2. Each binding group is matched to the corresponding target SonarCloud organization
3. Unbound projects fall back to the first configured organization
4. The mapping is exported as CSV for human review before execution

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Project Key Resolution

SonarCloud requires globally unique project keys across all organizations. CloudVoyager handles this with a smart fallback strategy:

1. Attempt to use the original SonarQube project key
2. If the key is already taken by another organization, fall back to `{org}_{key}`
3. If the key is already owned by the target organization (from a previous run), reuse it
4. All key conflicts are logged and reported in the migration summary

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### CSV Generation

The mapping module generates structured CSV files for:
- Organization assignments (which project goes where)
- DevOps binding groups (how projects are clustered)
- Project metadata (names, keys, binding info)
- Resource mappings (gates, profiles, templates per organization)

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 11. Concurrency Engine and Performance Optimization

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Zero-Dependency Concurrency Layer

CloudVoyager implements its own concurrency primitives (`src/utils/concurrency.js`) with **zero external dependencies**:

- **`createLimiter(n)`** — Bounds concurrent async operations to `n` at a time (functionally equivalent to `p-limit`, but without the dependency)
- **`mapConcurrent(items, fn, options)`** — Parallel map over items with bounded concurrency, supporting:
  - **Settled mode**: Collects errors rather than aborting, allowing partial success
  - **Progress callbacks**: Real-time logging of completion progress
  - **Configurable concurrency**: Different limits per operation type

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Per-Operation Concurrency Tuning

Different operations have different optimal concurrency levels, reflecting API rate limits and resource constraints:

| Operation | Default Concurrency | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Source file extraction | 10 | I/O-bound, benefits from parallelism |
| Hotspot detail fetching | 10 | Many small requests |
| Issue metadata sync | 5 | Write operations, moderate rate limits |
| Hotspot metadata sync | 3 | Aggressive SonarCloud rate limiting |
| Project migration | 1 | Heavy per-project workload |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Progress Tracking

Long-running concurrent operations emit progress logs (e.g., "Fetching sources: 142/350 completed") via `createProgressLogger`, giving operators real-time visibility into migration progress.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 12. Auto-Tuning and Adaptive Resource Management

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Hardware-Aware Configuration

The `--auto-tune` flag enables automatic performance configuration based on available system resources:

| Resource | Detection Method | Tuning Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| CPU cores | `os.availableParallelism()` | Scale concurrency from core count |
| System RAM | `os.totalmem()` | Set heap to 75% of RAM (max 16 GB) |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Auto-Tuned Concurrency Formulas

- `sourceExtraction` = CPU cores x 2
- `hotspotExtraction` = CPU cores x 2
- `issueSync` = CPU cores
- `hotspotSync` = min(max(CPU cores / 2, 3), 5)
- `projectMigration` = max(1, CPU cores / 3)

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Automatic Memory Management

When `maxMemoryMB` is configured (via auto-tune or explicit flag), the tool:

1. Checks the current V8 heap limit via `v8.getHeapStatistics()`
2. If insufficient, **re-spawns itself** with `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=<value>"`
3. Sets a `CLOUDVOYAGER_RESPAWNED=1` environment variable to prevent infinite respawn loops
4. Output streams seamlessly through the respawned process — the user sees no interruption

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Standalone Binary Detection

The respawn logic correctly detects whether it's running as a Node.js script or a standalone binary (Node.js SEA) by comparing `process.argv[0]` and `process.argv[1]`. This is critical because standalone binaries duplicate the executable path in argv, and incorrect detection would cause argument corruption on respawn.

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 13. Standalone Binary Packaging

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Zero-Install Distribution

CloudVoyager builds standalone binaries that users download and run directly — no Node.js installation, no `npm install`, no dependency management. Two packaging backends are supported:

| Backend | Command | Runtime | Best For |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Node.js SEA** | `npm run package` | Node.js | Production use — stable and well-tested (default) |
| **Bun Compile** | `npm run package:bun` | Bun | Faster builds, but may silently crash at runtime (experimental) |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Build Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Node.js SEA |
| macOS | x64 (Intel) | Node.js SEA |
| Linux | ARM64 | Node.js SEA |
| Linux | x64 | Node.js SEA |
| Windows | x64 | Node.js SEA |
| Windows | ARM64 | Node.js SEA |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Node.js SEA (Default)

The default packaging method uses **esbuild + Node.js SEA** (Single Executable Application):

1. **esbuild** bundles the source into `dist/cli.cjs` (with `.proto` schemas inlined as text)
2. A **SEA configuration blob** is generated with V8 code cache enabled
3. The host platform's `node` binary is copied
4. **postject** injects the SEA blob into the binary

Developers just run `npm run package` to build for their current platform.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Bun Compile (Experimental)

An experimental Bun compile pipeline is also available. Bun bundles and compiles in a single step — source goes directly to a native binary. While faster to build, Bun-compiled binaries have been observed to silently crash at runtime in some environments without any error message, making this unsuitable for production use at this time.

```bash
npm run package:bun          # Build for current platform (experimental)
npm run package:bun:cross    # Cross-compile 5 platforms (experimental)
```

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### CI/CD Build

The GitHub Actions workflow uses **6 parallel jobs** — one per target platform — each building a Node.js SEA binary natively on its respective runner (ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, macos-latest, macos-13, windows-latest, windows-11-arm).

## 14. Build Pipeline Optimizations

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### esbuild + Node.js SEA (Default)

The default build uses esbuild for bundling and Node.js SEA for packaging:

| Optimization | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Target: Node 21** | Modern syntax output, fewer polyfill transforms |
| **Minification** | Reduces bundle size by removing whitespace, shortening identifiers |
| **Tree Shaking** | Dead code elimination removes unused exports |
| **Proto as Text** | `.proto` files inlined as strings via esbuild's text loader |
| **CJS Output** | Single `dist/cli.cjs` file, compatible with SEA blob generation |
| **V8 Code Cache** | `useCodeCache: true` pre-compiles JavaScript to V8 bytecode for faster cold startup |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Bun Compile (Experimental)

An experimental Bun compile pipeline is also available as an alternative:

| Optimization | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Single-step compile** | Source → native binary in one command, no intermediate CJS bundle |
| **Proto as Text** | `.proto` files inlined as strings via `--loader .proto:text` |
| **Cross-compilation** | Multiple platform binaries from a single machine via `--target` |

While Bun offers faster build times and cross-compilation, it has been observed to silently crash at runtime in some environments, so the Node.js SEA pipeline is the recommended default.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Simplified Encoding Pipeline

An earlier architecture used **worker threads** for protobuf encoding. This was replaced with in-process encoding for greater reliability and simpler error propagation, with no measurable performance regression (encoding is CPU-bound but fast relative to network I/O).

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 15. Rate Limiting and API Resilience

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Two-Layer Rate Limiting Strategy

The SonarCloud API client implements a configurable two-layer approach:

**Layer 1: Exponential Backoff Retry**
- Triggers on HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Retries up to `maxRetries` times (default: 3)
- Delay doubles each attempt: `baseDelay × 2^(attempt-1)` (e.g., 1s → 2s → 4s)
- Logs warnings before each retry for operator visibility

**Layer 2: Write Request Throttling**
- POST requests are spaced at least `minRequestInterval` milliseconds apart
- Implemented via an Axios request interceptor
- Proactively prevents rate-limit triggers during high-volume write operations

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Graceful Degradation

- **Settled-mode concurrency**: Source file and hotspot extraction continue past individual failures, collecting errors rather than aborting
- **Non-fatal server-wide extraction**: The migration pipeline continues even if specific resource types fail to extract
- **Partial success handling**: Projects that fail during migration are logged and reported, but do not block other projects

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 16. Incremental and Stateful Transfers

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### State Tracking

CloudVoyager maintains a JSON state file that tracks:

```json
{
  "lastSync": "2026-02-18T12:00:00Z",
  "processedIssues": ["issue-key-1", "issue-key-2", "..."],
  "completedBranches": ["main", "develop"],
  "syncHistory": [
    { "timestamp": "...", "success": true, "stats": { "..." } }
  ]
}
```

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Incremental Mode

When `transfer.mode` is set to `"incremental"`:
- Issues are filtered by creation date (only issues created after `lastSync` are extracted)
- Previously processed issue keys are skipped
- Completed branches are not re-transferred
- State is updated only after successful upload, ensuring consistency

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Full Mode

When set to `"full"`, all data is re-extracted and re-transferred regardless of state. The state file is still updated to record the transfer.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### State Management Commands

- `cloudvoyager status` — View current sync state and transfer history (last 10 entries)
- `cloudvoyager reset` — Clear all state to force a full re-transfer

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 17. Comprehensive Reporting Suite

The migration pipeline generates reports in **6 formats** across **3 report types**:

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Report Types

| Report | Purpose | Audience |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Migration Report** | Full detailed breakdown of every migration step, per-project and per-org | Engineering teams |
| **Executive Summary** | High-level overview with success/failure counts and key metrics | Leadership and stakeholders |
| **Performance Report** | Timing analysis for each pipeline stage | Operations and optimization |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Output Formats

Each report type is generated in multiple formats:
- **JSON** — Machine-readable, for downstream tooling and dashboards
- **Markdown** — Rendered in GitHub/GitLab, wikis, and documentation systems
- **Plain Text** — Terminal-friendly, for quick review
- **PDF** — Presentation-ready, generated via `pdfmake` (best-effort; failures are logged but non-blocking)

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Report Content

Reports include:
- Per-project transfer status (success, failure, skipped)
- Per-organization resource migration summaries
- Issue and hotspot sync statistics (matched, transitioned, failed)
- Quality gate and quality profile migration results
- Permission and group creation results
- Error details with full context for failed operations
- Execution timing breakdowns per pipeline stage

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Quality Profile Diff Report

A specialized JSON report (`quality-profile-diff.json`) compares active rules per language between SonarQube source profiles and SonarCloud target profiles, identifying:
- **Missing rules**: Rules active in SonarQube but not available on SonarCloud
- **Added rules**: Rules on SonarCloud not present in SonarQube

---

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 18. Configuration System and Schema Validation

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Schema-Validated Configuration

All configuration is validated at startup using **Ajv (Another JSON Validator)** with strict schema enforcement. Validation errors are surfaced with specific field-level messages before any API calls are made.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Configuration Scopes

| Scope | Config File | Used By |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Single project transfer | `config.json` | `transfer` |
| Full migration | `migrate-config.json` | `migrate`, `sync-metadata` |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Environment Variable Overrides

Sensitive values can be provided via environment variables, keeping secrets out of config files:

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|----------|
| `SONARQUBE_TOKEN` | `sonarqube.token` |
| `SONARCLOUD_TOKEN` | `sonarcloud.token` |
| `SONARQUBE_URL` | `sonarqube.url` |
| `SONARCLOUD_URL` | `sonarcloud.url` |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Shared Schema Definitions

Performance and rate-limit schemas are shared across all configuration types, ensuring consistent tuning options regardless of migration scenario.

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 19. CLI Design and Operational Modes

<!-- Updated: Feb 21, 2026 at 10:30:00 AM -->
### Command Suite

| Command | Description | Key Flags |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `transfer` | Single project transfer | `--wait`, `--concurrency`, `--max-memory`, `--auto-tune` |
| `migrate` | Full multi-org migration | `--dry-run`, `--wait`, `--only <components>`, `--skip-issue-metadata-sync`, `--skip-hotspot-metadata-sync`, `--skip-quality-profile-sync`, `--concurrency`, `--max-memory`, `--project-concurrency`, `--auto-tune` |
| `sync-metadata` | Standalone metadata sync | `--skip-issue-metadata-sync`, `--skip-hotspot-metadata-sync`, `--skip-quality-profile-sync`, `--concurrency`, `--max-memory`, `--auto-tune` |
| `validate` | Configuration validation | — |
| `test` | Connection testing | — |
| `status` | View sync state | — |
| `reset` | Clear sync state | `-y` (skip confirmation) |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Operational Safeguards

- **`validate`** — Always run before migration to catch config issues early
- **`test`** — Verify connectivity to both SonarQube and SonarCloud before committing to a long migration
- **`--dry-run`** — Execute extraction and mapping without writing to SonarCloud
- **`--verbose`** — Debug-level logging for troubleshooting

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Logging

Winston-based logging with:
- Configurable levels via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Optional file output via `LOG_FILE` environment variable
- Structured timestamps and log formatting
- `--verbose` flag sets level to `debug`

## 20. Error Handling Architecture

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Custom Error Hierarchy

```
CloudVoyagerError (base)
├── ConfigurationError        (invalid config)
├── ValidationError           (schema validation failures)
├── SonarQubeAPIError         (SQ API failures with endpoint context)
├── SonarCloudAPIError        (SC API failures with endpoint context)
├── AuthenticationError       (401 errors with service identification)
├── ProtobufEncodingError     (encoding failures)
└── StateError                (state file read/write failures)
```

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Connection Error Diagnostics

API client errors include specific diagnostics based on the underlying network error:
- `ECONNREFUSED` — Server not running or wrong port
- `ETIMEDOUT` — Network timeout, possible firewall issue
- `ENOTFOUND` — DNS resolution failure, wrong URL

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Fail-Fast with Graceful Degradation

- **Critical failures** (config invalid, no connectivity, project not found) stop immediately with clear error messages
- **Non-critical failures** (individual resource extraction, single project in batch) are logged and reported but do not block the overall pipeline

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
## 21. Engineering Summary

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total source lines | ~8,100+ |
| Source files | 100+ |
| SonarQube extractor modules | 24 |
| SonarCloud migrator modules | 9 |
| CLI commands | 8 |
| Report output formats | 6 (JSON, MD, TXT, PDF x3 types) |
| Supported binary platforms | 6 (all via Node.js SEA) |
| Production dependencies | 9 |
| Resource types migrated | 12+ per organization |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### Key Engineering Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Reverse-engineer scanner protocol | No official migration path exists; this is the only way to avoid re-scanning |
| Zero-dependency concurrency | Avoid bloat; the custom implementation is ~80 lines and covers all use cases |
| Dual packaging backends (SEA + Bun) | Node.js SEA for stability (default), Bun compile as experimental alternative for faster builds |
| Inline proto schemas | Eliminate runtime file I/O dependencies for standalone binary compatibility |
| Builder-encoder separation | Clean architecture; business logic in builders, serialization in encoder |
| Non-fatal extraction | Maximize migration completeness even when individual items fail |
| Settled-mode concurrency | Partial success is better than total failure for large-scale operations |
| V8 code cache in SEA | Fast cold startup for the SEA backend |
| Auto-tune from hardware | One flag replaces manual tuning of 6+ concurrency/memory parameters |

<!-- Updated: Feb 20, 2026 at 04:02:35 PM -->
### What Makes This Novel

1. **No existing tool does this.** CloudVoyager is the first to reverse-engineer SonarScanner's protobuf protocol and reconstruct it programmatically.
2. **Zero source code access required.** The migration operates entirely at the API level — no repository cloning, no build systems, no CI/CD integration needed.
3. **Complete fidelity.** Issues, hotspots, measures, quality gates, quality profiles, permissions, groups, templates, portfolios, settings, tags, links, bindings, and new code periods are all preserved.
4. **Production-proven at scale.** Successfully migrated 29 projects with 16,000+ issues in a single automated run.
5. **Single binary, zero dependencies.** Distributed as a standalone executable — no runtime, no package manager, no setup.
6. **Fast.** 29 projects, 53 quality profiles, and all organizational configuration migrated in under 16 minutes.
