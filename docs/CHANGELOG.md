## Issue Batching: Distribute Large Issue Sets Across Multiple Dates (2026-04-20)

Projects with more than 5,000 issues per branch now automatically split into multiple scanner reports, each with a distinct `analysis_date`. This prevents SonarCloud's Elasticsearch visualization limit (10K per date bucket) from hiding migrated issues.

### New Feature

- **Issue batch distribution** — When a branch has >5,000 issues, they are split into batches of 5,000 and uploaded as separate scanner reports with backdated analysis dates (going backwards from today, one day per batch). The final batch carries the original date and full project data.
- **Shared utility** — `src/shared/utils/batch-distributor/` provides four pure-function helpers: `shouldBatch`, `computeBatchPlan`, `computeBatchDate`, `createBatchExtractedData`.
- **All 4 pipeline versions updated** — sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, and sq-2025 all integrate the batch distributor via a `shouldBatch` gate in `transferBranch`.
- **Upload size optimization** — Non-final batches strip `sources`, `changesets`, and `duplications` to minimize upload payload. `components` and `activeRules` are preserved for issue resolution.
- **Unique SCM revision per batch** — Each batch uses `randomBytes(20).toString('hex')` to generate a unique `scmRevisionId`, preventing CE deduplication across batches.

### Design Notes

- Batch size is hardcoded at 5,000 (50% safety margin under the 10K ES visualization limit)
- Batches are submitted oldest-first and always wait for CE completion before the next batch
- Branch-level stats are computed from the original (unbatched) data for accuracy
- No changes to the protobuf builder, encoder, or packager — batching operates at the `extractedData` level

## Desktop Migration Graph: Bug Fixes (2026-04-01)

Fixed four bugs in the desktop migration graph visualization component that caused incorrect node positioning, missing edges, blocked node activation, and inconsistent progress parsing.

All changes are in `desktop/src/renderer/js/components/migration-graph*.js`.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** Portfolios node overlapping with per-project Issues/Hotspots nodes in the migrate graph — moved the Portfolios node X position from `+560` to `+720` to eliminate the visual collision.
- **Fixed:** Missing base edge from `projects → portfolios` in the migrate graph definition — the edge was absent, causing the graph to render portfolios as disconnected from the projects node.
- **Fixed:** Portfolios node activation blocked by per-project config fanout edges — the dependency check was incorrectly counting project-specific child edges as unresolved dependencies. The check now excludes project nodes so the Portfolios node activates correctly when its real dependencies are met.
- **Fixed:** Inconsistent issue/hotspot sync completion patterns in the fallback log parser — `_tryParseProjectSubPhase` and `_parseSyncMetadataLine` now match the prefixed parser patterns used elsewhere, resolving cases where sync completion was silently missed in fallback mode.

<!-- Updated: Mar 28, 2026 -->
## Search Slicer: Fix 10K Limit on Large Projects (2026-03-28)

Fixed two bugs that caused transfers to fail for projects with more than 10,000 issues.

### Bug 1 — `10001th result asked` (Elasticsearch limit hit during date-range probe)

- **Root cause:** `slice-by-creation-date.js` called `findDateRange()` to determine the oldest/newest issue before building date windows. `findDateRange` used `getPaginatedFn` with `ps=1`, causing the paginator to loop page-by-page through all issues. On projects with >10K issues it reached page 10,001, which Elasticsearch rejects.
- **Fixed:** Removed `find-date-range.js` and the probing step entirely. `sliceByCreationDate` now uses a fixed epoch (`2006-01-01` → now) to build 12 equal-width time windows, requiring zero API calls to determine the date range.
- **Fixed:** Added an unsplittable-window guard in `fetchWindow` — if bisection reaches a same-millisecond boundary (e.g. mass-import scenarios where all issues share one timestamp), the window is fetched directly rather than looping forever.
- **Refactored:** Extracted `splitMidpoint` to `split-midpoint.js` and `buildDateWindows` to `build-date-windows.js` to keep all files under 50 lines.
- **Deleted:** `find-date-range.js` (contained the bug; no longer needed).

### Bug 2 — `Date cannot be parsed as either a date or date+time` (wrong datetime format)

- **Root cause:** JavaScript's `Date.toISOString()` produces `2007-09-08T21:21:02.125Z` (includes milliseconds). SonarQube's `createdAfter`/`createdBefore` API parameters reject this format and require `2007-09-08T21:21:02+0000`.
- **Fixed:** Added `format-sonarqube-date.js` helper that strips milliseconds and replaces `Z` with `+0000`. All date-window boundaries and midpoints now use this formatter.

### Bug 3 — Desktop app config validation failure (`/transfer must NOT have additional properties`)

- **Root cause:** The desktop transfer wizard set `transfer.skipIssueMetadataSync` and `transfer.skipHotspotMetadataSync` in the config, but these weren't declared in `transfer-options-schema.js`. The schema's `additionalProperties: false` rejected them.
- **Fixed:** Added both properties to the transfer options schema.

---

## Transfer Command: Metadata Sync (2026-03-27)

The `transfer` command now includes a **Phase 2: Metadata Sync** that runs automatically after the scanner report upload completes.

- **Added:** Issue metadata sync — replays full status history from SQ changelog, copies comments with attribution, adds `metadata-synchronized` tag, syncs assignments, and adds a `[SonarQube Source]` comment linking back to the original SQ issue URL.
- **Added:** Hotspot metadata sync — syncs hotspot statuses, comments, and source links.
- **Added:** `skipIssueMetadataSync` and `skipHotspotMetadataSync` options in transfer config to opt out.
- **Impact:** All 4 pipeline versions (sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025) now include metadata sync. Previously, the `transfer` command only uploaded the scanner report, leaving all issues in default "Open" status with no comments, tags, or assignments.

---

## External Issue Prefix Fix (2026-03-27)

Fixed a critical bug where **all external linter issues** (Ruff, Pylint, ESLint, Checkstyle, etc.) were silently dropped during migration from SonarQube 2025+.

- **Root cause:** SonarQube 2025+ returns external linter rules with an `external_` prefix (e.g., `external_ruff:D200`). SonarCloud's `/api/rules/repositories` includes `external_ruff` as a known repo, causing `isExternalIssue()` to misclassify these as native issues. SC then dropped them because no native rule `external_ruff:D200` exists.
- **Fixed:** `isExternalIssue()` now detects the `external_` prefix and always treats such rules as external — across all 4 pipeline versions (sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025).
- **Fixed:** External issue builders now strip the `external_` prefix from the engineId via a new shared `stripExternalPrefix()` utility, preventing a double `external_external_ruff:D200` prefix in SonarCloud.
- **Fixed:** sq-2025 issue model now preserves `externalRuleEngine` from SQ API responses.
- **Impact:** Affected up to 36 external linter types. Tested with `okorach-oss_sonar-tools` project (1,101 Ruff+Pylint issues previously dropped, now migrated correctly).

---

## CI Workflow Restructure (2026-03-26)

Restructured GitHub Actions workflows to simplify CI and automate versioning.

### Workflow Trigger Cleanup

All workflows now trigger **only on push to `main`**. Removed all `pull_request` triggers to prevent redundant runs on feature branches.

- **Changed:** `sonarcloud.yml` — removed `pull_request` trigger
- **Changed:** `unit-tests.yml` — removed `pull_request` trigger

### Separate Unit Tests Workflow

Unit tests are now a standalone workflow, decoupled from both SonarCloud scanning and regression tests.

- **New:** `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml` — standalone unit test workflow triggered on push to `main`
- **Changed:** `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` — removed test coverage step; now only runs SAST/SCA scanning
- **Changed:** `.github/workflows/regression.yml` — removed `unit-tests` job from regression pipeline
- **Changed:** `sonar-project.properties` — removed `sonar.tests`, `sonar.test.inclusions`, `sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths`, and `sonar.coverage.exclusions`

### Auto Version Bump from PR Milestone

Version bumping is now fully automated based on the milestone assigned to merged PRs.

- **New:** `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` — on PR merge, reads the milestone title and bumps `package.json` + `package-lock.json` (patch increment if same milestone, reset to `.0` if new milestone)
- **Changed:** `.github/workflows/gh-release.yml` — milestone link now uses the correct GitHub milestone integer ID (queried via API) instead of the version string
- **Changed:** `package.json` — version bumped from `1.1.2` to `1.2.0` for milestone 1.2

---

## Bug Fix Audit (2026-03-26)

A comprehensive codebase audit identified 83 issues. The following 10 high/medium severity bugs were fixed across 26 files.

- **Fixed:** Org-level verification was comparing SonarCloud to itself (passing `scClient` as both args to `runOrgChecks`). Now correctly constructs a `SonarQubeClient` for the SQ side.
- **Fixed:** Missing `await` on `syncIssueAssignment()` in sq-10.0 pipeline caused silent error swallowing and stats race conditions.
- **Fixed:** `ACCEPTED` status mapped to invalid `'accept'` transition in sq-9.9 and sq-10.0 pipelines (SonarCloud only supports `wontfix`). Now matches sq-10.4/sq-2025 correct mapping.
- **Fixed:** `ShutdownCoordinator` created but never passed to `handleMigrateAction` and `handleSyncMetadataAction`, preventing graceful cleanup on SIGINT.
- **Fixed:** `build-match-key.js` used `||` instead of `??` for line numbers, treating `line: 0` (file-level issues) as falsy. Fixed in sq-9.9, sq-10.4, and sq-2025.
- **Fixed:** `findDateRange` in search slicer had no null check — empty API results caused `NaN` timestamps and silent data loss.
- **Fixed:** CSV injection vulnerability in `escapeCsv()` — values starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` are now prefixed with a single quote inside double quotes.
- **Fixed:** XSS via `innerHTML` in Desktop app — `err.message` in connection-test and status screens, and `screen` variable in app.js, are now escaped with `ConfigForm.escapeHtml()`.
- **Fixed:** `createLimiter()` silently deadlocked when `concurrency` was 0, NaN, or negative. Now throws an error for invalid values.
- **Fixed:** Desktop config cross-contamination — verify-config and sync-metadata-config screens were saving to `migrateConfig`, overwriting migrate settings. Each now uses its own config key (`verifyConfig`, `syncMetadataConfig`) with backward-compatible fallback.

## Milestone 1.2 Fixes (2026-03-26)

The following four fixes were applied as part of the v1.2 milestone.

### Search Slicing for 10K+ Issues (#53)

SonarQube's `/api/issues/search` endpoint caps results at 10,000. Projects exceeding this limit now use date-window slicing to retrieve all issues.

- **New:** `src/shared/utils/search-slicer/` (5 files) — partitions the creation-date range into narrowing windows until each window returns fewer than 10K results
- **New:** `probe-total.js` added to each pipeline's `api-client/helpers/` (sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025) — probes the total issue count for a query
- **Modified:** `issues-hotspots.js` in all 4 pipelines now calls `fetchWithSlicing` when the total exceeds the 10K ceiling

### Third-Party Issue Migration Fix (#56)

Fixed silent loss of external (third-party) issues when the SonarCloud rule-repositories API was unreachable.

- **New:** `src/shared/utils/fallback-repos/index.js` — built-in set of 43 known SonarCloud rule repositories used as a fallback
- **Fixed:** `isExternalIssue()` falls back to `FALLBACK_SONARCLOUD_REPOS` when the live repo set is empty; handles rules without colons and empty repo prefixes
- **Fixed:** `getRuleRepositories()` retries the API call up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 s, 2 s, 3 s) and returns the fallback set if all retries fail

*(See the existing v1.1.9 entry below for per-file details.)*

### SonarCloud Public Scanning (#66)

Added automatic SAST/SCA scanning of the CloudVoyager repository via SonarCloud.

- **New:** `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` — triggers on push to `main` and on pull requests
- **New:** `sonar-project.properties` — SonarCloud project configuration (org, project key, sources, exclusions)
- **Requires:** `SONAR_TOKEN` secret configured in the GitHub repository

### Release Milestone References (#75)

GitHub releases now include the corresponding milestone link in the release body.

- **Modified:** `.github/workflows/gh-release.yml` — extracts the version tag, derives the milestone name, and appends a milestone link to the auto-generated release notes

### Desktop UI — Collapsible Config Sections

The migrate-config wizard now groups optional settings into collapsible sections that start collapsed by default, reducing visual clutter for new users.

- **Changed:** "Choose What to Migrate" section is now collapsed by default (collapsible with shield icon)
- **Changed:** "More Settings (Advanced)" section is now collapsed by default (collapsible with gear icon)

## [1.1.10] - 2026-03-26

### Bug Fix — Test Compatibility for Factory-Pattern Class Wrappers

Fixed 134 hook failures and 47 test failures caused by the refactored class wrappers (`SonarQubeClient`, `SonarCloudClient`, `ProtobufBuilder`, `ProtobufEncoder`, `EnterpriseClient`, `ReportUploader`) not being compatible with sinon prototype stubbing.

#### Root Cause
The major refactor (v1.1.7) converted monolithic classes into factory functions with thin class wrappers using `Object.assign(this, instance)`. This broke sinon's `sinon.stub(Class.prototype, 'method')` pattern because:
1. Methods existed as instance properties (from `Object.assign`), not on the prototype
2. Sinon requires methods to exist on the prototype before stubbing
3. Instance properties from `Object.assign` shadowed prototype stubs

#### Fix
- Added prototype method placeholders to all class wrappers so sinon can stub them
- Changed constructors to detect sinon stubs (via `isSinonProxy` flag) and skip overwriting them
- Added missing `handleError` method to `SonarQubeClient` factory
- Added missing `_findTaskFromActivity` method to `ReportUploader` class and factory
- Fixed `buildSubmitForm` to use `metadata.branchType` instead of hardcoded `'LONG'`
- Made `handleError` reference `instance.baseURL` dynamically instead of closure capture

#### Files Changed
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarqube/api-client/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarqube/api-client/helpers/create-sonarqube-client.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/api-client/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/protobuf/builder/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/protobuf/encoder/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/enterprise-client/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/uploader/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/uploader/helpers/create-report-uploader.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/uploader/helpers/build-submit-form.js`

## [1.1.9] - 2026-03-26

### Bug Fix — Third-Party Issue Migration (#56)

Fixed a bug where external (third-party) issues were silently dropped during migration when the SonarCloud `/api/rules/repositories` endpoint was unreachable or returned an error.

#### Root Cause
When `sonarCloudRepos` was empty (due to API failure), three layers of code conspired to skip all external issues:
1. `isExternalIssue()` returned `false` for every issue when the repo set was empty
2. `buildExternalIssues()` short-circuited with an early return when the repo set was empty
3. `getRuleRepositories()` returned an empty `Set` on any API error with no retry

#### Fix (applied across all 4 pipelines: sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025)
- **`isExternalIssue`** — Falls back to `FALLBACK_SONARCLOUD_REPOS` (a built-in set of known SonarCloud rule repos) when the live repo set is empty. Also adds guards for rules without colons and empty repo prefixes.
- **`buildExternalIssues`** — Removes the early-return that skipped processing; now logs a warning and continues with fallback data.
- **`getRuleRepositories`** — Retries the API call up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s). If all retries fail, returns `FALLBACK_SONARCLOUD_REPOS` instead of an empty set.

#### Files Changed
- `src/pipelines/sq-{9.9,10.0,10.4,2025}/protobuf/build-external-issues/helpers/is-external-issue.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-9.9/protobuf/build-external-issues/helpers/build-external-issues-core.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.0/protobuf/build-external-issues/index.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/protobuf/build-external-issues/helpers/build-external-issues.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-2025/protobuf/build-external-issues/helpers/build-external-issues-core.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-9.9/sonarcloud/api-client/helpers/query-methods-extended.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.0/sonarcloud/api-client/helpers/permission-query-methods.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/sonarcloud/api-client/helpers/extended-query-methods.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-2025/sonarcloud/api-client/helpers/query-methods-4.js`

## [1.1.8] - 2026-03-25

### Bug Fix — Broken Relative Import Paths After Folder Refactoring

Fixed 366 broken relative import paths across 325 files in `src/pipelines/`, `src/commands/`, and `src/version-router/`. After the folder-based module decomposition (v1.1.7), helper files nested inside new subfolder structures had incorrect `../` counts in their relative paths to `src/shared/` and to sibling pipeline modules.

#### Root Cause
Files moved one level deeper (e.g., from `module.js` into `module/helpers/fn.js`) still used the old `../` count, causing imports to resolve to `src/pipelines/shared/` instead of `src/shared/`.

#### Scope
- **358 shared/ imports** fixed across `src/pipelines/sq-9.9/`, `sq-10.0/`, `sq-10.4/`, and `sq-2025/`
- **8 intra-pipeline imports** fixed (transfer-pipeline, rule-helpers, quality-profiles, find-task-from-activity)
- **1,652 files** verified — all relative imports now resolve correctly
- CLI verified working via `node src/index.js --help`

---

## [1.1.7] - 2026-03-25

### Code Architecture Refactoring — Folder-Based Module Decomposition

Refactored all 55+ files exceeding 50 lines in `src/pipelines/sq-10.4/` into a folder-based module architecture. Every large file is now decomposed into `module-name/index.js` + `module-name/helpers/*.js`, with a 1-line re-export file at the original path preserving all existing import paths.

#### Architecture Pattern
- **Module pattern:** `big-file.js` → `big-file.js` (re-export) + `big-file/index.js` (orchestrator) + `big-file/helpers/*.js` (one function per file)
- **Factory functions over classes:** `SonarQubeClient` → `createSonarQubeClient()`, `SonarCloudClient` → `createSonarCloudClient()`, `ProtobufBuilder` → `createProtobufBuilder()`, `DataExtractor` → `createDataExtractor()`. Thin class wrappers preserved for backward compatibility.
- **All files ≤50 lines** — down from 55+ files exceeding the limit (largest was 641 lines)
- **Zero public API changes** — all import paths remain the same via re-export files

#### Key Metrics
- **Before:** 73 JS files, 9,317 total lines, 55+ files over 50 lines
- **After:** 404 JS files, 8,656 total lines, 0 files over 50 lines
- **Dead code removed:** `checkpoint-extractor.js`, `ce-submitter.js`, `report-packager.js`, `project-core-migrator.js`, `project-metadata-sync.js`, `project-config-migrator.js`

#### Largest Files Decomposed
| Original File | Lines Before → After | Helper Files |
|---|---|---|
| `sonarqube/extractors/index.js` | 641 → 42 | 20 helpers |
| `transfer-pipeline.js` | 478 → 2 | 15 helpers |
| `pipeline/project-migration.js` | 453 → 6 | 21 helpers |
| `sonarcloud/uploader.js` | 381 → 2 | 10 helpers |
| `sonarcloud/api-client.js` | 360 → 1 | 8 helpers (+ 4 delegate files) |
| `sonarcloud/migrators/issue-sync.js` | 308 → 1 | 12 helpers |
| `migrate-pipeline.js` | 307 → 1 | 10 helpers |
| `pipeline/org-migration.js` | 304 → 6 | 10 helpers |
| `sonarcloud/migrators/hotspot-sync.js` | 293 → 1 | 15 helpers |
| `sonarqube/api-client.js` | 259 → 1 | 12 helpers |
| `protobuf/build-external-issues.js` | 257 → 1 | 11 helpers |
| `protobuf/builder.js` | 227 → 1 | 10 helpers |

## [1.1.6] - 2026-03-25

### Regression Testing Suite

Added a comprehensive GitHub Actions regression testing workflow that runs all CLI feature/flag combinations in parallel.

- **30 parallel integration test jobs** covering all `migrate`, `sync-metadata`, and `verify` flag combinations
- **4-stage pipeline graph** visible in the Actions UI: setup → quality → integration tests → summary
- **Completely separate** from the release workflow — does not block asset builds
- **Matrix strategy** with `fail-fast: false` so one failure doesn't cancel other tests
- **Config generation from secrets** — `migrate-config.json` built at runtime from GitHub Secrets
- **Composite actions** for shared steps (dependency restore, config generation)
- Triggers automatically on push to `main` and on pull requests

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-25

### Desktop App — SonarCloud Organization Validation

- **config-form.js** — Added `validateOrgs()` method that enforces at least one SonarCloud organization is present and all required fields (org key, token) are filled before allowing the user to proceed.
- **migrate-config.js** — Org step Next button now calls `ConfigForm.validateOrgs()` before advancing.
- **sync-metadata-config.js** — Org step Next button now calls `ConfigForm.validateOrgs()` before advancing.
- **verify-config.js** — Org step Next button now calls `ConfigForm.validateOrgs()` before advancing.
- Shows a toast notification when no organizations have been added.

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-25

### Pipeline Modularization and New Components

Refactored project migration into modular components and added new capabilities across all 4 pipeline versions (sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025).

#### Pipeline Decomposition
- **project-config-migrator.js** — Extracted project config migration into its own module (settings, tags, links, new code periods, DevOps binding, quality gate/profile assignment, permissions). Uses journal-guarded steps for pause/resume.
- **project-core-migrator.js** — Extracted core project migration (scanner report upload + project config) as Phase 1 of project migration. Returns context needed for Phase 2.
- **project-metadata-sync.js** — Extracted issue + hotspot metadata sync as Phase 2 of project migration. Runs issue and hotspot sync in parallel.
- **transfer-branch.js** — Extracted single-branch build→encode→upload pipeline into its own module, used by both transfer and migrate commands.

#### Report Packaging and CE Submission
- **report-packager.js** — Extracted scanner report ZIP creation into its own module. Handles all protobuf file types (metadata, components, issues, external issues, ad-hoc rules, measures, duplications, changesets, sources, active rules, context-props).
- **ce-submitter.js** — Extracted CE submission with robust retry mechanism: submit → timeout fallback to `/api/ce/activity` polling (5 checks) → re-submit → poll again → fail with descriptive error.

#### Issue Status Mapping
- **issue-status-mapper.js** — Extracted issue status transition mapping from changelog diffs. Maps SonarQube status changes (CONFIRMED, REOPENED, RESOLVED, CLOSED, ACCEPTED, FALSE-POSITIVE, WONTFIX) to SonarCloud transitions. Handles SQ 10.4+ where WONTFIX/FALSE-POSITIVE appear as direct status values.

#### Checkpoint-Aware Extraction
- **checkpoint-extractor.js** — Extracted checkpoint-aware data extraction with journal + cache support. Implements 13-phase extraction pipeline (project metadata, metrics, components, source files, rules, issues, hotspots, measures, sources, duplications, changesets, symbols, syntax highlighting) with per-phase caching and resume capability. Also supports branch-specific extraction.

#### CSV Entity Filtering
- **csv-entity-filters.js** — New shared module for filtering extracted entities using dry-run CSV overrides. Supports filtering quality gates, quality profiles, groups, global permissions, permission templates, portfolios, and user mappings by Include column.

#### Verification Report Modularization
- **markdown-sections/** and **pdf-sections/** — Modularized verification report generation into separate section modules (detail-sections.js, project-results.js) for both Markdown and PDF formats.

#### Desktop App Enhancements
- **progress-parser.js** — New component that parses CLI log output in real-time to compute progress percentages and ETA for all three pipeline types (migrate, transfer, verify). Tracks per-project sub-phases and displays remaining time estimates.
- **whale-animator.js** — New component rendering a pixel-art whale sprite animation with starfield, cloud parallax, and typewriter phase labels during execution. Supports dark/light themes.

#### Files Added (per pipeline × 4 versions)
- `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/pipeline/project-config-migrator.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/pipeline/project-core-migrator.js`
- `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/pipeline/project-metadata-sync.js`

Refactored the entire codebase from a flat structure with a single `VersionAwareSonarQubeClient` to a **pipeline-per-version** architecture. Each supported SonarQube version range now has its own fully independent pipeline directory containing all version-specific code.

#### Architecture Change
- Moved all version-specific code from flat `src/` directories into `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/` directories (sq-9.9, sq-10.0, sq-10.4, sq-2025)
- Moved all version-independent shared code into `src/shared/` (config, mapping, reports, state, utils, verification)
- Added `src/version-router.js` to detect SonarQube version and dynamically load the correct pipeline
- Removed `VersionAwareSonarQubeClient` — each pipeline now has its own `SonarQubeClient` with version-specific behavior hardcoded
- No runtime version checks exist within any pipeline — all version differences are resolved by the pipeline selection

#### Benefits
- **Zero cross-version regressions** — changes to one pipeline cannot affect another
- **Easier maintenance** — each pipeline is self-contained and independently testable
- **Clear version boundaries** — no hidden runtime branching or fallback chains
- **Simpler debugging** — all version-specific behavior is in one directory

#### Pipeline Differences
| Behavior | sq-9.9 | sq-10.0 | sq-10.4 | sq-2025 |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Issue search param | `statuses` | `statuses` | `issueStatuses` | `issueStatuses` |
| MetricKeys limit | Batched (15) | Batched (15) | Batched (15) | No batching |
| Clean Code source | SC enrichment map | Native from SQ | Native from SQ | Native from SQ |
| Groups API | Standard | Standard | Standard | Web API V2 fallback |

#### Files Restructured
- **Moved:** `src/sonarqube/` → `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/sonarqube/` (per-version)
- **Moved:** `src/sonarcloud/` → `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/sonarcloud/` (per-version)
- **Moved:** `src/protobuf/` → `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/protobuf/` (per-version)

- **Moved:** `src/transfer-pipeline.js` → `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/transfer-pipeline.js` (per-version)
- **Moved:** `src/migrate-pipeline.js` → `src/pipelines/sq-{version}/migrate-pipeline.js` (per-version)
- **Moved:** `src/config/` → `src/shared/config/`
- **Moved:** `src/mapping/` → `src/shared/mapping/`
- **Moved:** `src/reports/` → `src/shared/reports/`
- **Moved:** `src/state/` → `src/shared/state/`
- **Moved:** `src/utils/` → `src/shared/utils/`
- **Moved:** `src/verification/` → `src/shared/verification/`

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Cross-Compile Support and macOS x64 Desktop App

#### Cross-Platform SEA Binary Building
- Added `--target=<platform>` flag to `scripts/build.js` for cross-compiling Node.js SEA binaries (e.g., building a macOS x64 binary from an ARM64 Mac)
- When cross-compiling, the build script downloads the correct Node.js binary for the target architecture from nodejs.org and injects the SEA blob into it
- Supported targets: `macos-x64`, `macos-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`

#### CI/CD Fix: macOS x64 Binary
- Fixed `build-sea-macos-x64` GitHub Actions job — previously used `macos-13` (unavailable) then `macos-15` (ARM64, producing wrong architecture binary)
- Now runs on `macos-latest` (ARM64) with `--target=macos-x64` for cross-compilation

#### macOS x64 Desktop App
- Added `build:mac-x64` npm script to the desktop app for building macOS Intel `.dmg` installers
- Added `build-desktop-macos-x64` job to GitHub Actions workflow
- Platform count increases from 5 to 6 for the desktop app

#### Files Modified
- **Modified:** `scripts/build.js` — added `--target` flag, `downloadNodeBinary()` function, cross-compile logic in `seaPackage()`
- **Modified:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` — `build-sea-macos-x64` uses `macos-latest` with cross-compile
- **Modified:** `.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml` — added `build-desktop-macos-x64` job
- **Modified:** `desktop/package.json` — added `build:mac-x64` script

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Bug Fix: SonarCloud Issue Sync Failure (FALSE_POSITIVE Status Parameter)

Projects were being marked as **partial** because the "Sync issues" step failed for every project with:
> `Value of parameter 'statuses' (FALSE_POSITIVE) must be one of: [OPEN, CONFIRMED, REOPENED, RESOLVED, CLOSED]`

The SonarCloud `/api/issues/search` endpoint was being called with `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `ACCEPTED`, and `FIXED` appended to the `statuses` parameter. SonarCloud does not accept these values — `FALSE_POSITIVE` and `WONTFIX` are *resolutions* in SonarCloud (issues appear as `RESOLVED` with a `resolution` field), while `ACCEPTED` and `FIXED` are SonarQube 10.4+ statuses that SonarCloud's API does not support. The fix restricts the SonarCloud issue search to `OPEN,CONFIRMED,REOPENED,RESOLVED,CLOSED` only, which correctly captures all issues including false positives.

#### Files Modified
- **Fixed:** `src/sonarcloud/api/issues.js` — removed invalid SonarCloud statuses from `ALL_STATUSES` constant

#### Documentation Fixes
- **Fixed:** `docs/key-capabilities.md` — issue transition mapping had `FALSE-POSITIVE → wontfix` (incorrect); corrected to `FALSE-POSITIVE → falsepositive`; added missing `REOPENED → reopen`, `OPEN → unconfirm`, and `CLOSED → resolve` transitions
- **Fixed:** `docs/troubleshooting.md` — example migration report outputs were missing the `Assign quality profiles` step between `Assign quality gate` and `Project permissions`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### 2026-03-10 — Incremental Migrations with Pause/Resume

#### New Feature: Checkpoint Journal System
- Added a **write-ahead checkpoint journal** that tracks phase-by-phase progress for both `transfer` and `migrate` commands, enabling true pause/resume across all migration workflows
- Interrupted migrations (CTRL+C, crashes, network failures) can now be resumed from the exact point of interruption — no re-processing of completed work
- The journal stores a session fingerprint (SonarQube version, URL, project key) and validates it on resume, warning on version mismatches

#### Graceful Shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- First CTRL+C: finishes the current atomic operation, saves progress to the journal, releases the lock, and exits cleanly
- Second CTRL+C: forces immediate exit
- Cleanup handlers are registered for saving state, releasing locks, and flushing logs

#### Concurrent Run Prevention
- Advisory lock file (`<stateFile>.lock`) prevents two instances from running on the same state file simultaneously
- Stale lock detection: auto-releases locks from dead processes (PID check) or locks older than 6 hours
- Different-hostname locks require `--force-unlock` for NFS safety

#### Extraction Caching
- Extraction results are cached to disk as gzipped JSON files, so resumed runs skip already-completed extraction phases
- Cache files auto-purge after 7 days (configurable via `transfer.checkpoint.cacheMaxAgeDays`)
- Corrupt cache files are handled gracefully (phase re-executes)

#### Upload Deduplication
- Before re-uploading after a crash, checks `/api/ce/activity` for existing CE tasks from the current session
- Prevents duplicate CE tasks — the most dangerous edge case in crash-during-upload scenarios

#### Migration Journal (Multi-Project)
- Per-organization and per-project completion tracking for the `migrate` command
- On resume: completed orgs and projects are skipped, in-progress projects resume from their last completed step
- Output directory is preserved on resume (no longer wiped)

#### Atomic State Writes
- State files now use write-to-temp, `fsync`, then atomic rename — prevents corruption on crash
- Backup rotation: current state is copied to `.backup` before each save
- Safe load with fallback: tries main file, then `.backup`, then returns null
- Disk space pre-check (10MB minimum) before writing

#### New CLI Flags
- `--force-restart` — Discard checkpoint/migration journal and start from scratch (`transfer`, `migrate`)
- `--force-fresh-extract` — Discard extraction caches and re-extract everything (`transfer`)
- `--force-unlock` — Force release a stale lock file from a previous run (`transfer`, `migrate`)
- `--show-progress` — Display checkpoint progress table and exit (`transfer`)

#### New Config Options
- `transfer.checkpoint.enabled` — Enable/disable checkpoint journal (default: `true`)
- `transfer.checkpoint.cacheExtractions` — Enable/disable extraction caching (default: `true`)
- `transfer.checkpoint.cacheMaxAgeDays` — Max age of cache files in days (default: `7`)
- `transfer.checkpoint.strictResume` — Fail on SonarQube version mismatch when resuming (default: `false`)

#### Enhanced Commands
- `status` command now shows checkpoint journal progress (phases, branches, completion %) when a journal exists
- `reset` command now clears checkpoint journals, lock files, and extraction caches in addition to state files

#### Files Added
- **New:** `src/state/lock.js` — Advisory lock file with PID-based stale detection
- **New:** `src/utils/shutdown.js` — Graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM coordination
- **New:** `src/state/checkpoint.js` — Phase-level checkpoint journal

- **Modified:** `src/migrate-pipeline.js` — Migration journal and conditional output-dir preservation
- **Modified:** `src/pipeline/project-migration.js` — Per-step checkpoints in migration journal
- **Modified:** `src/config/schema.js` — Added `transfer.checkpoint` config block
- **Modified:** `src/commands/transfer.js` — New CLI flags, shutdown coordinator
- **Modified:** `src/commands/migrate.js` — New CLI flags, shutdown coordinator
- **Modified:** `src/index.js` — Enhanced `status` and `reset` commands

### 2026-03-10 — User Mapping CSV for Issue Assignment

#### New Feature: User Mapping
- Added `user-mappings.csv` to the dry-run CSV workflow, enabling SonarQube-to-SonarCloud user login mapping
- During `--dry-run`, CloudVoyager now collects all unique issue assignees across all projects using lightweight facet queries and enriches them with display names and emails from the SonarQube user API
- Users can fill in the `SonarCloud Login` column to map SQ logins to SC logins, or set `Include=no` to skip assignment for specific users (e.g., service accounts)
- During the actual migration, the user mapping CSV is automatically loaded and applied to issue assignments

#### Issue Assignment Improvements
- Issue assignment now supports three modes per user: mapped (SQ login → SC login), excluded (skip assignment), or passthrough (original behavior)
- Added `assignmentMapped` and `assignmentSkipped` counters to issue sync statistics
- Failed assignment reports now include both the original SQ assignee and the target SC assignee when a mapping was used
- Updated Markdown, text, and PDF report formatters with a "Target Assignee" column in the failed assignments table

#### Files Added/Modified
- **New:** `src/sonarqube/extractors/users.js` — `extractUniqueAssignees()` (facet-based) and `enrichAssigneeDetails()` (user API)
- **Modified:** `src/mapping/csv-tables.js`, `csv-generator.js`, `csv-applier.js` — generate, read, and apply user mappings
- **Modified:** `src/migrate-pipeline.js` — collect assignees during dry-run, pass `userMappings` through `ctx`
- **Modified:** `src/pipeline/project-migration.js` — forward `userMappings` to `syncIssues()`
- **Modified:** `src/sonarcloud/migrators/issue-sync.js` — apply user mapping before assignment
- **Modified:** `src/reports/format-markdown.js`, `format-text.js`, `pdf-sections.js` — show mapped assignee in failure reports

#### Documentation
- Updated dry-run CSV reference with `user-mappings.csv` schema, examples, and edit scenarios
- Updated key capabilities, troubleshooting, changelog, and README

---

### 2026-03-09 — SonarQube 9.9 & 2025.1 Backward Compatibility

#### New: Version-Aware SonarQube Client
- Added `VersionAwareSonarQubeClient` subclass (`src/sonarqube/version-aware-client.js`) that auto-detects the SonarQube server version and adapts API calls accordingly
- All backward-compatibility logic is **isolated** in the subclass — the base `SonarQubeClient` and all API modules remain untouched
- Version is detected once on connection and cached for the lifetime of the client

#### Version-Aware Issue Fetching
- **SonarQube < 10.4**: Uses legacy `statuses` parameter with combined pre-10.4 and 10.4+ status values
- **SonarQube >= 10.4 / 2025.1**: Uses modern `issueStatuses` parameter, avoiding deprecation warnings and future breakage
- Falls back to legacy behavior when version is unknown (safe default)

#### Defensive API Wrappers
- `getGroups()` wrapped with try/catch for `/api/user_groups/search` endpoint being migrated to Web API V2

#### Version Utilities
- Added `isAtLeast(version, major, minor)` to `src/utils/version.js` for generic version comparisons
- Works with both old numbering (9.9, 10.4) and the new 2025.x year-based scheme

#### Pipeline Simplification
- `transfer-pipeline.js` and `pipeline/org-migration.js` now use the client's cached version instead of inline `getServerVersion()` + `parseSonarQubeVersion()` calls

#### Documentation
- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with comprehensive guide to all codebase patterns and conventions (extractor, API module, migrator, client, isolation, error handling, pagination, concurrency, testing)
- Updated `docs/backward-compatibility.md` with version-aware client architecture, issue status parameter differences, and expanded version support table
- Added SonarQube version compatibility section to `README.md` with support matrix
- Added `sonarqubeCompatibility` metadata and version keywords to `package.json`
- Updated documentation table in `README.md` with backward compatibility and contributing links

---

### 2026-03-04 — Issue Status History Verification

#### Enhancement: `verify` Command
- Added **status history (changelog) verification** to the issue metadata checker
- Fetches changelogs from both SonarQube and SonarCloud via `/api/issues/changelog`
- Extracts status transitions from each changelog and compares them in order
- Flags issues where SQ transitions are missing from SC as `statusHistoryMismatches`
- Issues with no status changes (never transitioned) are skipped
- Added `getIssueChangelog` to the SonarCloud API client
- Updated Markdown, PDF, and console reports to include status history mismatch details
- Updated verification documentation with new check description and pass/fail criteria

---

### 2026-02-28 — Migration Verification Command

#### New Feature: `verify` Command
- Added a `verify` command that exhaustively compares SonarQube and SonarCloud data to confirm migration completeness
- Performs read-only checks — no data is modified in either SonarQube or SonarCloud
- Reuses the existing migration config file (no new config schema needed)
- Supports the same `--only` component filtering as the `migrate` command

#### Verification Checks
- **Per-project:** Issue matching (status, assignments, comments, tags), hotspot matching (status, comments), branch parity, measures comparison, quality gate/profile assignments, project settings, tags, links, new code periods, DevOps bindings, project permissions
- **Org-wide:** Quality gates (existence + conditions), quality profiles (existence + rule counts), groups, global permissions, permission templates
- **Unsyncable detection:** Reports issue type changes, issue severity changes, and hotspot assignments as warnings (expected differences that cannot be synced via API)

#### Verification Reports
- Generates reports in 3 formats: **JSON**, **Markdown**, and **PDF** to the `--output-dir` directory (default: `./verification-output`)
- Console summary with per-project pass/fail breakdown and unsyncable warnings
- Markdown report includes collapsible detail sections for status, assignment, comment, and tag mismatches

#### npm Scripts
- Added `verify`, `verify:auto-tune`, and 8 selective `verify:only-*` npm scripts

#### Documentation
- Updated architecture, key capabilities, configuration, local development, scenario guides, troubleshooting, and README to document the verify command
- Updated hidden HTML timestamps across all modified files

- Reports include executive summaries, per-project breakdowns, and performance timing analysis
- Enables stakeholders to review migration outcomes at a glance

#### Quality Profile Diff Reports
- Added side-by-side comparison of active rules per language between SonarQube and SonarCloud
- Identifies rule discrepancies after profile migration, so teams can verify policy parity before go-live

#### New Code Period Migration
- Migrates "new code" period definitions (used for quality gate evaluations) to SonarCloud via the settings API
- Supports all SonarQube new code period types with automatic mapping to SonarCloud equivalents

#### Auto-Tune Performance
- Added `--auto-tune` flag that detects available CPU cores and RAM to automatically configure concurrency and memory limits

### 2026-02-17 — Full Migration Pipeline, Metadata Sync, and Concurrency

#### Full Migration Pipeline (`migrate` command)
- **Issue metadata sync** — migrates issue statuses, assignments, comments, and tags from SonarQube to SonarCloud
- **Hotspot metadata sync** — migrates security hotspot statuses and review comments
- **Permissions migration** — transfers global permissions, project-level permissions, and permission templates
- **Portfolio migration** — recreates portfolios in SonarCloud while preserving project associations
- **Project settings migration** — migrates tags, links, DevOps bindings, and project-level configuration
- **Quality gates migration** — transfers gate definitions, conditions, project assignments, and access permissions
- **Quality profiles migration** — uses backup/restore to transfer profiles via XML; built-in profiles are migrated as custom copies with inheritance chains and permissions preserved
- Added 12 new data extractors covering DevOps bindings, groups, hotspots, new code periods, permissions, portfolios, project links, project settings, project tags, quality gates, quality profiles, and server info (plugins + webhooks)

#### Standalone Metadata Sync (`sync-metadata` command)
- Added a dedicated command for syncing issue and hotspot metadata independently of the main migration
- Designed to be safely retryable — can be re-run without duplicating data
- Generates detailed migration reports with per-organization and per-project summaries

#### Rate Limiting
- Added configurable rate limiting for SonarCloud API write requests with exponential backoff on 503/429 responses
- Prevents API throttling during large-scale migrations

#### Concurrency and Performance Tuning

- Custom zero-dependency concurrency layer for parallel task execution with configurable limits
- Performance configuration can be passed to all migration and transfer functions

#### Documentation and Configuration
- Added comprehensive configuration documentation with examples for migration and bulk transfer scenarios
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect new migration pipeline components
- Added LICENSE file for open-source compliance
- Created scenario-based migration guides:
  - **Single project** — migrate one specific project
  - **Single organization** — migrate all projects to one SonarCloud organization
- Removed outdated usage guide (content consolidated into scenario documents)

### 2026-02-16 — Core Transfer Engine, CLI, Build System, and Initial Documentation

#### Data Extraction Engine
- Built the core extraction engine that pulls all relevant data from SonarQube via its REST API:
  - Project metadata, branches, and quality gate associations
  - Issues with full pagination support and incremental sync capability
  - Measures and metrics at both project and component level
  - Source code files with configurable extraction limits
  - SCM blame/changeset data for accurate authorship tracking
  - Active rules from quality profiles, filtered to languages in use
  - Symbol references and syntax highlighting data
- Supports incremental transfers — tracks previously synced data to avoid reprocessing on subsequent runs

#### CLI Interface
- Commander-based CLI with four core commands:
  - `transfer` — extract from SonarQube, build protobuf report, upload to SonarCloud
  - `validate` — validate configuration file before running
  - `status` — view current sync state and transfer history
  - `reset` — clear sync state to force a full re-transfer
- Supports `--verbose` flag for detailed debug output
- Tokens can be provided via environment variables (`SONARQUBE_TOKEN`, `SONARCLOUD_TOKEN`) to avoid storing secrets in config files

#### Protobuf Report Builder
- Transforms extracted SonarQube data into protobuf-encoded scanner reports matching SonarCloud's internal Compute Engine format
