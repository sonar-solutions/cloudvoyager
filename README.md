# ☁️ 🐋 CloudVoyager

<!-- Last updated: 2026-02-19 -->

Migrate your data from self-hosted SonarQube to SonarCloud — no re-scanning needed. This was done by reverse-engineering SonarScanner (scan report protobuf files) & then fully rebuilding everything from the ground up on Node.js.

CloudVoyager copies everything — projects, code issues, security hotspots, quality gates, quality profiles, permissions, and more — directly from SonarQube into SonarCloud.

## 🔥 Single Command Full Migration (Slightly Dangerous)

1. Download the latest release of CloudVoyager from the [releases page](https://github.com/sonar-solutions/cloudvoyager/releases).
2. Ensure that you have full admin access API tokens for your SonarQube server and your SonarCloud organization.
3. Create the `migrate-config.json` file with the required information (see the [full migration docs](docs/scenario-single-org.md) for details).
4. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
./cloudvoyager migrate -c migrate-config.json --verbose --auto-tune
```
5. Once the migration finishes, review the `./migration-output` directory for any errors or warnings, and verify that your projects and data have been migrated successfully to SonarCloud.
